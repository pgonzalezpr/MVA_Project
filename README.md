# MVA_Project

This repository contains relevant documentation for the Multivariate Analysis course project. The project must include the following steps:

1. Selection: The student group will select a problem and its associate data set. You must read the corresponding documentation trying to understand what the goals of the problem are.

2. Pre-process of data: The student group will perform a preliminary summary of the data (exploratory data analysis), which will allow the detection of errors, outliers, and missing values and, thus, take the appropriate measures of correction. According to the problem and data, it may be necessary to perform a selection of variables (feature selection) and /or a derivation of new explanatory variables (feature extraction) if the problem requires it.

3. Preparing data for analysis: The student group will choose the type of protocol for the validation, i.e., split up the data set in a training and a test sample to assess the quality of the final model. Depending on the data size, it wonâ€™t make sense to have a separate test data file.

4. Analysis: The student group will perform a multivariate analysis of the training data set, leaving the test data as supplementary. As a group, you must discuss and choose which multivariate techniques are the more appropriate for your problem. Among other possible results, you must at least show a visualization of the information, detection of the hidden latent factors, the synthesis of the complexity by clustering, and interpretation of the results, which must be contextualized.

5. Prediction: Depending on the undertaken problem, the student group will choose a model for prediction of the response variable, will find its optimal parameters, and will assess its performance according to the established validation protocol.
